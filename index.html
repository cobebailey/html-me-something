<p class="class-text">Barbarians are fierce, primitive warriors who hail from the outskirts
    of society. They're battle-hardened people, who value strength and
    hardiness above all. They focus on Strength and Constitution, and
    are capable of entering a rage, enhancing their combat capabilities.
    Barbarians come alive in the chaos of combat. They can enter a berserk state where rage takes over, giving them superhuman strength and resilience. A barbarian can draw on this reservoir of fury only a few times without resting, but those few rages are usually sufficient to defeat whatever threats arise.

<p class="class-text">
        Fighters learn the basics of all combat styles. Every
        fighter can swing an axe, fence with a rapier, wield a
        longsword or a greatsword, use a bow, and even trap foes
        in a net with some degree of skill. Likewise, a fighter is
        adept with shields and every form of armor. Beyond that
        basic degree of familiarity, each fighter specializes in a
        certain style of combat. Some concentrate on archery,
        some on fighting with two weapons aI once, and some
        on augmenting their martial skills with magic. This
        combination of broad general ability and extensive
        specialization makes fighters superior combatants
        on battlefields and in dungeons alike.

<p class="class-text">
    Monks make careful study of a magical energy that most
    monastic traditions call ki. This energy is an element
    of the magic that suffuses the multiverse-specifically,
    the element that flows through living bodies. Monks
    harness this power within themselves to create magical
    effects and exceed their bodies' physical capabilities,
    and some of their special attacks can hinder the flow of
    ki in their opponents. Using this energy. Monks channel
    uncanny speed and strength into their unarmed strikes.
    As they gain experienee, their martial training and their
    mastery of ki gives them more power over their bodies
    and the bodies of their foes.

alt="Paladin img">
<p class="class-text">
    A paladin swears to uphold justice and righteousness,
    to stand with the good things of the world against the
    encroaching darkness, and to hunt the forces of evil
    wherever they lurk. Different paladins focus on various
    aspects of the cause of righteousness, but all are
    bound by the oaths that grant them power to do their
    sacred work. Although many paladins are devoted to
    gods of good, a paladin's power comes as much from a
    commitment to justice itself as it does from a god.
    Paladins train for years to learn the skills of combat,
    mastering a variety of weapons and armor. Even so,
    their martial skills are secondary to the magical power
    they wield: power to heal the sick and injured, to smite
    the wicked and the undead, and to protect the innocent
    and those who join them in the fight forjustice.

<img

class="fl-img"

alt="ranger img">
<p class="class-text">
    Warriors of the wilderness, rangers specialize in
    hunting the monsters that threaten the edges of
    civilization-humanoid raiders, rampaging beasts and
    monstrasities, terrible giants, and deadly dragons. They
    learn to track their quarry as a predator does, moving
    stealthily thraugh the wilds and hiding lhemselves in
    brush and rubble. Rangers focus their combat training
    on techniques that are particularly useful against their
    specific favored foes.
    Thanks to their familiarity with the wilds, rangers
    acquire the ability to cast spells that harness nature's
    power, much as a druid does. Their spells, like their
    combat abilities, emphasize speed, stealth, and the hunt.
    A ranger's talents and abilities are honed with deadly
    focus on the grim task of protecting lhe borderlands.

alt="rogue img">
<p class="class-text">
    Rogues devote as much effort to mastering the use of
    a variety of skills as they do to perfecting their combat
    abilities, giving them a broad expertise that few other
    characters can match. Many rogues focus on stealth and
    deception, while others refine the skills that help them
    in a dungeon environment, such as climbing, finding and
    disarming traps, and opening locks.
    When it comes to combat, rogues prioritize cunning
    over brute strength. A rogue would rather make one
    precise strike, placing it exactly where the attack will
    hurt the target most, than wear an opponent down
    with a barrage of attacks. Rogues have an almost
    supernatural knack for avoiding danger, and a few learn
    magical tricks to supplement their other abilities.
